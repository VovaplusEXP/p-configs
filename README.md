# P-Configs: Curated and Optimized Proxy Configurations

This repository automatically gathers, cleans, validates, and enriches proxy configurations from various public sources. It is designed to provide fresh, high-quality, and de-duplicated lists for use in various proxy clients.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Updates**: The lists are automatically updated via GitHub Actions every 6 hours, ensuring you always have the freshest configs.
- **Smart Deduplication**: An intelligent deduplication process ensures that only functionally unique servers remain, ignoring cosmetic differences like names.
- **Informative Naming**: Configurations are automatically renamed to a standard, informative format: `PROTOCOL-TRANSPORT-ENCRYPTION-FLAG(COUNTRY_CODE)-HOST:PORT`.
- **Geo-IP Location**: Server locations are identified using a batch IP geolocation API to provide country information for most servers.
- **Multiple Formats**: Lists are provided in both plain-text (one config per line) and Base64-encoded formats for maximum client compatibility.
- **Secure-Only Lists**: For VLESS and VMess, separate lists are generated containing only configurations that use `TLS` or `REALITY` encryption.
- **Validation**: Basic validation is performed on all configs to filter out malformed or invalid entries.

## üöÄ How to Use (Subscription Links)

Copy the link for the list you want to use and add it as a new subscription in your proxy client (e.g., Nekoray, v2rayN, Clash, etc.).

### Plain-Text Lists

These lists contain one configuration link per line. Ideal for clients that support this format.

| Protocol | Standard List | Secure-Only List (TLS/REALITY) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VLESS** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol/vless.txt` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol-Secure/vless.txt` |
| **VMess** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol/vmess.txt` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol-Secure/vmess.txt` |
| **Trojan** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol/trojan.txt` | (N/A) |
| **SS** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol/ss.txt` | (N/A) |
| **All** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/All_Configs_Sub.txt` | (N/A) |

### Base64-Encoded Lists

These lists contain all configurations for a given protocol, joined together and encoded in Base64. This is the most widely supported format.

| Protocol | Standard List (Base64) | Secure-Only List (Base64) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VLESS** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol-Base64/vless.txt` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol-Secure-Base64/vless.txt` |
| **VMess** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol-Base64/vmess.txt` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol-Secure-Base64/vmess.txt` |
| **Trojan** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol-Base64/trojan.txt` | (N/A) |
| **SS** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VovaplusEXP/p-configs/main/Splitted-By-Protocol-Base64/ss.txt` | (N/A) |

## üìÅ Directory Structure

- `Splitted-By-Protocol/`: Contains the primary, plain-text lists, separated by protocol.
- `Splitted-By-Protocol-Secure/`: Contains plain-text lists of only VLESS/VMess configs with TLS/REALITY.
- `Splitted-By-Protocol-Base64/`: Contains Base64-encoded versions of the primary lists.
- `Splitted-By-Protocol-Secure-Base64/`: Contains Base64-encoded versions of the secure-only lists.
- `All_Configs_Sub.txt`: A single file containing all processed plain-text configs.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (For Developers)

The entire process is orchestrated by the `.github/workflows/main.yml` GitHub Actions workflow, which runs on a schedule.

1.  **`Files/app.py`**: The main script is executed. It reads subscription URLs from `Files/Subscription-List.txt`, fetches all configs, performs smart deduplication in memory, validates them, enriches them with Geo-IP data, and writes the primary lists to `Splitted-By-Protocol/`.
2.  **`Files/filter_secure.py`**: This script runs next. It reads the lists generated in the previous step and creates a new set of lists in `Splitted-By-Protocol-Secure/`, containing only configs that explicitly use TLS or REALITY.
3.  **`Files/create_base64_lists.py`**: This final script reads all the plain-text lists generated by the previous two steps and creates Base64-encoded versions of them.
4.  **Commit**: The GitHub Action commits all the generated and updated `.txt` files back to the repository.
